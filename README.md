# Salem ELA Library Management System
Project for someone I know. A Maven webapp, since i figured going with Java would be the fastest thing for me.

I swear some day I'll switched out the commented code in Application.java with real unit and integration tests haha.

## Goal
Student types ID and then scans QRCode with their mobile app to check out.

To check in, scan the QRCode of the book again.

Teacher should have a simple time adding books & QR codes. Master list of library books will be downloaded from S3 as a .csv

---------------
Plans subject to change... For now the backend has been established. I'll figure out UX later.
